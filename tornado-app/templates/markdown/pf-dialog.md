##### Getting Started

1. Zoom to your area of interest on the map until you can see the catchments outlined in Green (these are HUC12)
2. Use your cursor to select the one or multiple green HUC12 catchments. You will see a box outlining the area that the tool will subset. _Note: if the box outline is Red, the catchment you have selected is too large to subset_
3. Once you are satisfied with selected area, press the _Submit_ button in the lower right corner below the map.
4. Your catchment is being subsetted! Wait for the tool to process...
5. Download your tar.gz file containing the domain files necessary to run the ParFlow at the area you selected.

##### Considerations

- Try to select a headwaters catchment, as the tool does not currently support upstream tracing.
