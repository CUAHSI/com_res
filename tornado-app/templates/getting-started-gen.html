<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <em>Map</em> tab</li>
<li>Zoom to your area of interest on the map until you can see the catchments outlined in Green (these are HUC12)</li>
<li>Use your cursor to select the one or multiple green HUC12 catchments. You will see a box outlining the area that the tool will subset. <em>Note: if the box outline is Red, the catchment you have selected is too large to subset</em></li>
<li>Once you are satisfied with selected area, press the <em>Submit</em> button in the lower right corner below the map.</li>
<li>Your catchment is being subsetted! Wait for the tool to process…</li>
<li>Download your tar.gz file containing the domain files necessary to run the NWM at the area you selected</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="considerations">Considerations</h6>
<ul>
<li>Try to select a headwaters catchment, as the tool does not currently support upstream tracing.</li>
<li>Remember when you use the domain to run your model, you must spin it up until you have reached “realistic” conditions, as the subsetter tool does not provide initial RESTART files.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h6>
<p>The model results obtained using the NWM v1.2.2 domain are not a direct reflection of the operational NOAA/NWS National Water Model.</p>
