<li>Zoom to your area of interest on the map until you can see the catchments outlined in Green (these are HUC12)</li>
<li>Use your cursor to select the one or multiple green HUC12 catchments. You will see a box outlining the area that the tool will subset. <em>Note: if the box outline is Red, the catchment you have selected is too large to subset</em></li>
<li>Once you are satisfied with selected area, press the <em>Submit</em> button in the lower right corner below the map.</li>
<li>Your catchment is being subsetted! Wait for the tool to process...</li>
<li>Download your tar.gz file containing the domain files necessary to run the ParFlow at the area you selected.</li>
</ol>
